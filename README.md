# Data Collection, Preprocessing and Model Training
In this course, I worked primarily on the following: A Data Collector Module that can download data through any API; an Advanced Data Preprocessing Module that can process time series data even when the time has been entered in a haphazard fashion, handle missing data through imputation, and output the data in a specified format; a Time Converter Module that can break the Datetime into different components- year,month,day,hour,minute,second and can facilitate prediction on any of those components, an XGBoost Model Training Module, and a Random Forests Training Module. I also created an AWS sagemaker notebook instance that can collect data from an S3 bucket, pre-process the data and store it in another S3 bucket.
